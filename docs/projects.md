- ### Collabium | Task Management App
    ---
    **Associated with:** UBC Okanagan - COSC 310

    Collabium is a full-stack web application designed to help teams manage tasks efficiently with features like secure user authentication, role-based access, task filtering, and an admin dashboard. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, the system supports CI/CD, task notifications, and detailed team performance tracking.

    While working on Collabium, I contributed to backend development (login system, task filtering) and frontend features (admin user management). I also played a key role in organizing the team’s workflow—maintaining documentation, keeping out Kanban board up to date with relevant tasks, coordinating meetings, and helping the team stay on schedule in an unofficial scrum master capacity.

- ### AmazeBike | Unity WebGL Game
    ---
    **Associated with:** UBC Okanagan - COSC 416
    
    Built collaboratively with a team of three for our COSC 416 final project, AmazeBike is a Unity-based 3D platformer inspired by Excitebike. Players race through two tracks of increasing difficulty, dodging mud pits and hitting speed boosts to finish with the best time possible. The game includes a tutorial, visual and audio effects, and a top-three leaderboard system to encourage replayability. Power-ups like immunity help players overcome obstacles, while fireworks and music add to the immersive experience.
